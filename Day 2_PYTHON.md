## ðŸ”¹ 1. Scraping

Scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It simulates how a user would browse a website but collects and stores data for analysis or automation. If a website allows scraping, we can use tools like BeautifulSoup or Selenium to pull that data. This is useful when there's no official API.

Example:

    When you want to collect product prices from an e-commerce site automatically.
  
  Legal/Ethical Note:
  
    Always check the website's robots.txt or terms of service.

  What users interact with: HTML, CSS, JS.
  
  Tools like Chatbots, LLMs may use scraped data for responses.
  
  ## ðŸ”¹ Back End:
  
  The part where scraping is done using code and tools.
  
  Sends HTTP requests and parses responses.
