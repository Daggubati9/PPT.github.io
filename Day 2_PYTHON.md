## 🔹 1. Scraping

Scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It simulates how a user would browse a website but collects and stores data for analysis or automation. If a website allows scraping, we can use tools like BeautifulSoup or Selenium to pull that data. This is useful when there's no official API.

Example:

    When you want to collect product prices from an e-commerce site automatically.
  
  Legal/Ethical Note:
  
    Always check the website's robots.txt or terms of service.

  ## 🔹 Front End:
  
  What users interact with: HTML, CSS, JS.
  
  Tools like Chatbots, LLMs may use scraped data for responses.
  
  ## 🔹 Back End:
  
  The part where scraping is done using code and tools.
  
  Sends HTTP requests and parses responses.

## 🧰 2. Python Libraries for Scraping

## ✅ BeautifulSoup

Used to parse static HTML content.
    
Easy and lightweight.

Example:


        from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
        import requests
        
        url = "https://example.com"
        res = requests.get(url)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(res.text, 'html.parser')
        print(soup.title.text)
        
## ✅ Selenium

Used for dynamic content (JavaScript-based pages).

Automates browsers (Chrome, Firefox).

Example:

        from selenium import webdriver
        driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        driver.get("https://example.com")
        print(driver.title)

## 3. Virtual Environment & Poetry

## 🔹 Why Virtual Environments?

Keeps your project’s dependencies separate from global Python packages.

Prevents version conflicts.

## 🔹 Using venv (basic way):

        python -m venv env
        source env/bin/activate  # or env\Scripts\activate on Windows
        
## 🔹 Using Poetry (modern way):

Automatically handles dependency versions and virtual environments.

        pip install poetry
        poetry init  # creates pyproject.toml
        poetry add beautifulsoup4 selenium
        poetry shell  # activates the environment

## ✅ 4. Probability (Basic Idea)

Probability is the measure of how likely an event is to happen.

It ranges from 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100%).

        Example: The probability of flipping a coin and getting heads = 0.5.

## ✅ Conditional Probability

This is the probability of an event happening given that another event has already occurred.

            Formula:
    
            P(A∣B)= P(A∩B)/ P(B)
​
        Example:
        
        A bag has 3 red and 2 blue balls.
        
        If you know a ball is not blue, what's the chance it's red?
        
        Given it's not blue (so only red balls left), the chance it's red is 100%.

## ✅ Expected Value (Expectation)

The average result if you repeat a random process many times.

            E(X)=∑(xi⋅P(xi))
        
        Example:
        
        Rolling a fair die:
        
        E=(1+2+3+4+5+6)/6=3.5
        
## ✅ 4. Mean

The mean is just the average of numbers.

        Formula:
        Mean= (x1+x2+⋯+xn)/n
​
        Example:
        
        Numbers: 2, 4, 6 → Mean = (2+4+6)/3 = 4

## ✅ 5. Variance

Variance measures how much values are spread out around the mean.

        Formula:
        
        Variance= n∑(xi−μ)2/n
 
        Example:
        
        If values are all close to the mean, variance is small. If values vary a lot, variance is large.

## ✅ 6. Self-Explanatory

In your notes, self-explanatory likely refers to topics that are simple enough to understand on their own, like:

        Mean → everyone knows it’s an average.
        
        Expected value → just like taking average results.
        
        Probability → how likely something is to happen.
        
        These concepts are foundational and often used in:
        
        Surveys (like elections),
        
        Games (dice, cards),
        
        AI/ML models (prediction based on probability).

## 📊 What is a Distribution?

A probability distribution is a statistical function that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range.

    A distribution shows how data values are spread.
    
    Helps in understanding the probability of outcomes.
    
    Common in data science, machine learning, and statistics.


## ⭐ Bernoulli Distribution

A Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution for a random variable which takes the value 1 with probability p and the value 0 with probability 1-p.

    Only two outcomes: Success (1) or Failure (0)

    One trial only (e.g., tossing a coin)
    
    Formula: P(X=1) = p, P(X=0) = 1-p
    
    Example: Did a user click the button? Yes = 1, No = 0

## ✔️ Binomial Distribution

A binomial distribution summarizes the likelihood that a value will take one of two independent values under a given set of parameters or assumptions.

    Multiple independent Bernoulli trials
    
    Answers: How many successes in n trials?
    
    Formula: P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)
    
    Example: Out of 10 exams, how many did you pass?

## ⚙️ Data Preparation Steps

Data preparation is the process of cleaning and transforming raw data prior to processing and analysis. It's an essential step for accurate results in data science.

Step 1: Understand (Under)

    Know your dataset (binary/categorical/numeric)

Step 2: Clean

    Handle missing values
    
    Encode values (e.g., Yes/No -> 1/0)

Step 3: Prepare

    Format data for analysis

Define probabilities and count of trials

## 📈 Types of Distributions

| **Distribution** | **Description**                       | **Example**                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Bernoulli**    | One trial with two outcomes (0 or 1)  | Tossing a coin (Heads = 1, Tails = 0) |
| **Binomial**     | Repeated Bernoulli trials             | Passing 7 out of 10 quizzes           |
| **Normal**       | Bell-shaped curve for continuous data | Heights of students in a class        |
| **Poisson**      | Counts events in a fixed interval     | Calls received per minute             |
| **Uniform**      | All outcomes equally likely           | Rolling a fair six-sided die          |
| **Exponential**  | Time between independent events       | Time between bus arrivals             |

Example:

        from scipy.stats import bernoulli, binom
        
        print(bernoulli.pmf(1, 0.7))     # Output: 0.7
        print(binom.pmf(5, 10, 0.5))     # 5 successes in 10 trials

## ✅ Distribution of X

A distribution shows how the values of a random variable 𝑋. X are spread — or how likely each value is."

    Example:
    Rolling a 6-sided die.
    X = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
    P(X) = 1/6 for each value
    
## ✅ Expectation (Expected Value)

Expectation is the average value we expect after many repetitions of a random process.

    Formula: E[X]=∑xi⋅P(xi)

    Example:
        Rolling a fair die: E[X]=1⋅1/6+2⋅1/6+⋯+6⋅1/6=3.5

## ✅ Discrete Random Variable

A discrete variable has countable outcomes.

    Example:
    
    Number of heads when tossing 3 coins
    𝑋=0,1,2,3

If you can count the values one by one, it's discrete.
        
## ✅ Continuous Random Variable

A continuous variable can take any value in a range — even decimals.

    Example:
    
    Height of a student
    X∈[140,190] cm

Between 150 cm and 151 cm, there are infinite possible values.

## ✅ Mean (Expected Value)

The average number of successes in n trials.

        Formula:
        
        E[X]=np
        
        Example:
        
        Toss a fair coin 10 times
        
        Probability of heads 
        
        p=0.5
        
        E[X]=10×0.5=5
        
👉 We expect 5 heads on average.

## ✅ Variance

Tells us how spread out the number of successes is from the mean.

    Formula:
    
    Var(X)=np(1−p)
    
    Example:
    
    n=10, 
    
    p=0.5
    
    Var(X)=10×0.5×(1−0.5)=2.5
    
    👉 So, the variance is 2.5.

## ✅ Standard Deviation

The square root of the variance. It shows the typical deviation from the mean.

    Formula:
    
    SD= square root of np(1−p)
    ​
    Example:
    
    SD= Square root of 2.5≈1.58
 
👉 So, the standard deviation is approx. 1.58

| Concept                | Formula                 | Example Result (n = 10, p = 0.5) |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Mean**               | $E[X] = np$             | $10 \times 0.5 = 5$              |
| **Variance**           | $Var(X) = np(1 - p)$    | $10 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 2.5$ |
| **Standard Deviation** | $SD = \sqrt{np(1 - p)}$ | $\sqrt{2.5} \approx 1.58$        |

Example:

    n=7600
    
    p=5%=0.05
    
    ✅ 1. Mean (Expected Value)
    
    E[X]=np=7600×0.05=380
    
    ✅ 2. Variance
    
    Var(X)=np(1−p)=7600×0.05×(1−0.05)=7600×0.05×0.95=361
    
    ✅ 3. Standard Deviation
    
    SD=Squareroot of Var(X)=Squareroot of 361=19

## ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?

EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. It is the first step in analyzing any dataset. The goal is to understand the structure of the data, detect patterns, find missing or duplicate values, and clean the data before moving to model building or visualization. EDA helps us make better decisions about how to handle the data — for example, whether we need to clean it, remove columns, or transform some values.

    Example:
    
    Think of it like checking the quality of ingredients before cooking.

## ✅ Key Steps of EDA

## ✅ 1. Reading a Dataset

First, we load the data to start exploring. Load the file into a data frame using tools like Python (Pandas).

    Python Example (if using Pandas):
    
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
    df.head()
    
    Explain:
    
    read_csv loads the file
    
    head() shows the first 5 rows

## ✅ 2. Analyzing the Data

We look at the data types, column names, and get summary statistics. Check types, stats with info()/describe().

    Python Example:
    
    df.info()
    df.describe()
    
    Explain:
    
    info() → shows data types, missing values
    
    describe() → shows mean, min, max, etc. for numeric columns

## ✅ 3. Checking for Duplicates

Duplicates can affect analysis. We need to check and remove them. Find with duplicated().sum()

    Python Example:
    
    df.duplicated().sum()
    df = df.drop_duplicates()
    
    Explain:
    
    duplicated().sum() tells how many duplicates
    
    drop_duplicates() removes them

## ✅ 4. Calculating Missing Values

Missing values need special handling — we may remove them or fill them.

    Python Example:
    
    df.isnull().sum()
    
    Explain:
    
    This shows missing values column by column
    
    Optional Fixes:
    
    df.fillna(0, inplace=True)  # Fill with 0
    
    # OR
    
    df.dropna(inplace=True)     # Drop rows with missing values

## ✅ Correlation Matrix

A correlation matrix shows the relationships between numerical variables in a dataset. Each cell shows the correlation value between two variables. This helps us find patterns and make better decisions during analysis.

## ✅ Types of Visualization for Correlation

| Plot Type                | Purpose / What to Say                                                                                      | Draw or Show                           |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 📊 **Bar Plot**          | “Used to show comparison between categories.”                                                              | Refer to bar chart sketch.             |
| ⚫ **Scatter Plot**       | “Used to see the relationship between two variables. If the dots go in a line, the variables are related.” | Refer to scatter sketch.               |
| 📦 **Box Plot**          | “Used to show the spread of the data and detect outliers.”                                                 | Use the box plot sketch.               |
| 📈 **Pipeline Gap Plot** | “A custom visual showing trend or gap. Not very common, but used for progress lines.”                      | Use your drawing.                      |
| 🔥 **Heatmap**           | “This shows the correlation matrix with colors. Strong correlation = dark color, weak = light.”            | Use the heatmap sketch.                |
| 🤝 **Pair Plot**         | “Shows scatter plots between all pairs of variables.”                                                      | Mention `sns.pairplot()` from Seaborn. |

## ✅ Tools & Libraries

## ✅ Important Pandas Functions for EDA

    📌 pd.read_csv('filename.csv')
    
Use:
Reads a CSV (comma-separated values) file and loads it into a DataFrame (a table-like structure in pandas).

Example:

    df = pd.read_csv('winequality-red.csv')
    
Explanation:

This line reads the CSV file and stores it in a variable df. Now we can explore and analyze this dataset.

    📌 df.head()
    
Use:

Displays the first 5 rows of the dataset.

Example:

    df.head()
    
Explanation:

This helps you quickly see what the data looks like – the column names, the values, and the format.

    📌 df.shape
    
Use:

Returns the number of rows and columns in the dataset.

Example:

    df.shape
    
Explanation:

Useful to know the size of the dataset. For example, (1000, 12) means 1000 rows and 12 columns.

    📌 df.info()

Use:

    📌 df.describe()
    
Use:

Gives summary statistics for all numeric columns.

Example:

    df.describe()
    
Shows count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles. This helps you understand the range and distribution of your data.

    📌 list(df.columns)
    
Use:

Lists the names of all columns in the dataset.

Example:

    list(df.columns)
    
Helps when you want to know or use column names for plotting, filtering, or feature selection.

    📌 df.isnull().sum()
    
Use:

Checks for missing values in each column.

Explanation:

Useful to detect if you need to clean the data.

    📌 df.duplicated().sum()
    
Use:
