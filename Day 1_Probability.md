## 1.🔹Variable
A variable is a symbol (like x or y) used to represent a value that can change.

## 2.🔹 Random Variable
A random variable is a variable whose value is the outcome of a random process.

Example: Let X be the number of heads when flipping 2 coins.

## 3.🔹 Experiment
An experiment in probability is a process or action that leads to a result.

Example: Tossing a coin, rolling a die.

## 4.🔹 Random Experiment
An experiment where the outcome cannot be predicted with certainty.

Example: Rolling a die — you don’t know which number you’ll get.

## 5.🔹 Outcome
An outcome is a single possible result of an experiment.

Example: Getting a 5 when rolling a die.

## 6.🔹 Basic Outcome
Same as an elementary outcome — a single result in the sample space.

Example: Getting tails in one coin flip.

## 7.🔹 Sample Outcome / Sample Space
Sample Space (S): The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.

Example: For a coin flip → S = {Heads, Tails}

## 8.🔹Type of Random Variables:-
## 🔹Discrete Random Variable
Takes on countable values (usually whole numbers).

Example: Number of heads in 3 coin tosses → 0, 1, 2, 3.

## 🔹Continuous Random Variable
Takes on infinite values in a range (like real numbers).

Example: Height, time, weight.

## 9.🔹Events
An event is one or more outcomes of an experiment.

Example: Rolling an even number → {2, 4, 6}

## 10.🔹Function / f(x)
A function assigns each input (x) to a specific output.

In probability: often refers to the Probability Function.

## 11.Type of Functions:-
🔹 Probability Mass Function (PMF)
Used for discrete random variables. It gives the probability of each possible value.

Notation: P(X = x)

Example: P(X = 2) = 0.3

🔹 Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
Gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a value.

Notation: F(x) = P(X ≤ x)

Used for both discrete and continuous variables.

🔹 Probability Density Function (PDF)
Used for continuous random variables.

Describes the likelihood of the variable falling within a range, not a specific point.

Notation: f(x)

## 12🔹 Set Theory
A collection of well-defined elements.

🔹Example: A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Union (A ∪ B): All elements in A or B (or both)

Intersection (A ∩ B): Elements in both A and B

Difference (A − B): Elements in A but not in B

Complement (A′): All elements in the universal set not in A

🔹Example:
The manager of a factory claims that among his 400 employees.
‾ 312 got a pay rise last year
‾ 248 got increased pension benefits last year
‾ 173 got both pension benefits and pay rise last year
‾ 13 got neither

calculate the probability of.
a)Getting a pay rise    
b)Not getting a pay rise 
c)Getting both a pay rise and pension benefits 
d)Getting no pay rise or benefit increase 
e)Getting a pay rise or benefits 

Answer is:
Let's use set theory to solve this. Define:

Total employees = 400

𝐴
A: Employees who got a pay rise = 312

𝐵
B: Employees who got pension benefits = 248

𝐴
∩
𝐵
A∩B: Employees who got both = 173

Neither = 13

From this, we calculate:

a) Getting a pay rise
𝑃
(
Pay Rise
)
=
312
400
=
0.78
P(Pay Rise)= 
400
312
​
 =0.78
b) Not getting a pay rise
𝑃
(
No Pay Rise
)
=
1
−
𝑃
(
Pay Rise
)
=
1
−
0.78
=
0.22
P(No Pay Rise)=1−P(Pay Rise)=1−0.78=0.22
c) Getting both a pay rise and pension benefits
𝑃
(
Pay Rise and Benefits
)
=
173
400
=
0.4325
P(Pay Rise and Benefits)= 
400
173
​
 =0.4325
d) Getting no pay rise or benefit increase (i.e., neither)
𝑃
(
Neither
)
=
13
400
=
0.0325
P(Neither)= 
400
13
​
 =0.0325
e) Getting a pay rise or benefits (i.e., 
𝐴
∪
𝐵
A∪B)
Use the formula:

𝑃
(
𝐴
∪
𝐵
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
+
𝑃
(
𝐵
)
−
𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B)
=
312
+
248
−
173
400
=
387
400
=
0.9675
= 
400
312+248−173
​
 = 
400
387
​
 =0.9675
