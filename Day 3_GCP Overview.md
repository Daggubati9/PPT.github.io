## ☁️ 1. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Overview:-
🔹 GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
A cloud service by Google to run apps, store data, and use computing power online.

Offers tools for computing, databases, AI, networking, and storage.

🔹 Project
A logical container for GCP resources (APIs, storage, compute, etc.).

All billing, IAM, and services are tied to a project.

🔹 Terraform
Open-source tool for automating cloud infrastructure.

Manages GCP resources using code (Infrastructure as Code).

## 🔐 2. Access Control in GCP:-
🔹 IAM (Identity and Access Management)
Manages who can access what in GCP.

Provides fine-grained access control to resources.

🔹 Roles

Primitive Role: Broad access roles (Viewer, Editor, Owner).

Predefined Role: Service-specific roles like "Storage Admin" or "BigQuery Viewer".

Custom Role: User-defined roles with tailored permissions.

| Role      | ✅ Permissions                          | 🚫 Restrictions                       | 🎯 Use When                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 📄 Viewer | Can view content                       | Cannot edit, comment, or share        | You want someone to read only                |
| ✏️ Editor | Can view, comment, and edit            | Cannot delete, share, or manage roles | Collaboration is needed but no admin access  |
| 👑 Owner  | Full control over content and settings | —                                     | You created the content or need admin rights |

🔹 Service Account

Special Google account used by apps or VMs to access GCP services securely.

## 📊 3. API Services and Usage:-
Billing Based on Usage: Charges apply per use (compute time, storage, queries).
Billing Account: Needed to activate and pay for GCP services.

## 🌐 4. Networking:-
🔹 Virtual Networking
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) enables secure communication between resources.

Uses components like subnets, firewalls, and IP addresses.

🔹 VPC
A private, isolated network inside GCP.

Works like an online version of your own data center with full control.

🔹 Firewall
Filters traffic in and out of your GCP network.

Protects resources by allowing or denying traffic based on rules.

## 5. GCP Storage options:
| **Storage Type**     | **Description**                                                                              | **Types of Files Stored**                                                                                                 |

| **Dataflow**                   | Used for real-time or batch data processing and transformation (Apache Beam).       |
| **Cloud Functions**            | Event-driven, lightweight functions to trigger pipelines (e.g., after file upload). |
| **Cloud Run**                  | Container-based execution of pipeline components triggered via HTTP.                |
| **Pub/Sub**                    | Event/message streaming to trigger other GCP services or steps in a pipeline.       |
| **Workflows**                  | Connects and automates GCP services into serverless workflows.                      |

 ## 🔄Use Case Example
Cloud Storage upload → triggers Cloud Function → publishes message to Pub/Sub → starts Dataflow → loads data into BigQuery.

These tools help automate, scale, and simplify your pipelines without needing external infrastructure.
